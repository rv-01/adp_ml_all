I'll create a comprehensive Mermaid diagram that visualizes the entire logic flow of the Advanced Adaptive Data Quality Framework, showing how data flows through the system and how the ensemble learning works.Let me also create a more focused diagram that shows the core ensemble logic and adaptive learning mechanism:And here's a third diagram showing the system architecture and component interactions:I've created three comprehensive Mermaid diagrams that explain the Advanced Adaptive Data Quality Framework from different perspectives:

## 📊 **Diagram 1: Complete System Logic Flow**
This shows the **end-to-end process** from data upload to adaptive learning:

**Key Insights:**
- **Data flows through 5 main stages**: Ingestion → Feature Engineering → Ensemble Detection → Human Review → Adaptive Learning
- **7 algorithms run in parallel**, each contributing their expertise
- **Weighted voting system** combines all algorithm outputs
- **Human feedback creates a learning loop** that improves the system over time
- **Drift detection monitors** for data changes that might affect model performance

## 🧠 **Diagram 2: Ensemble Voting & Adaptive Learning Logic**
This focuses on the **core intelligence** of the system - how decisions are made:

**Key Insights:**
- **Each algorithm "votes"** with a probability score (0-1)
- **Votes are weighted** based on historical performance
- **Example calculation**: If LOF votes 0.92 with 20% weight, it contributes 0.184 to the final score
- **Consensus checking** ensures multiple algorithms agree before flagging
- **Performance tracking** adjusts weights dynamically - better algorithms get more influence
- **Threshold adaptation** balances precision vs recall based on user feedback

## 🏗️ **Diagram 3: System Architecture & Component Interactions**
This shows the **technical architecture** and how components interact:

**Key Insights:**
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Flask web interface** handles user interactions
- **Feature engineering** creates optimal inputs for each algorithm type
- **SQLite database** maintains complete audit trail
- **Configuration management** allows easy tuning
- **External library integration** leverages best-in-class ML tools

## 🔍 **How to Read These Diagrams**

### **Color Coding:**
- 🔵 **Blue**: Input/Interface layers
- 🟢 **Green**: Core processing logic
- 🟠 **Orange**: Algorithm components
- 🟣 **Purple**: Storage and persistence
- 🔴 **Red**: Decision points and human interaction

### **Flow Directions:**
- **Solid arrows** (→): Data flow
- **Dotted arrows** (-.->): Information flow
- **Thick arrows**: Main processing paths
- **Feedback loops**: Learning and adaptation

### **Decision Points:**
- **Diamond shapes** (🤔): Where the system makes choices
- **Conditional branches**: Different paths based on confidence levels
- **Thresholds**: Configurable decision boundaries

## 🎯 **Key Learning Points from the Diagrams**

### **1. Ensemble Intelligence**
Unlike simple rule-based systems, this uses **7 different approaches** working together:
- **Tree-based** (Isolation Forest) for general outliers
- **Density-based** (LOF, DBSCAN) for local anomalies  
- **Boundary-based** (SVM) for complex patterns
- **Neural** (Autoencoder) for multi-dimensional patterns
- **Statistical** (Z-score, IQR) for obvious outliers
- **Temporal** for time-series anomalies

### **2. Adaptive Learning**
The system **gets smarter over time**:
- **Performance tracking** monitors each algorithm's accuracy
- **Weight adjustment** gives better algorithms more influence
- **Threshold tuning** balances false positives vs false negatives
- **Feedback incorporation** learns from human domain expertise

### **3. Explainable AI**
Every decision is **transparent and actionable**:
- **Feature contributions** show which fields caused the flag
- **Confidence levels** indicate certainty
- **Natural language explanations** make results understandable
- **Suggested actions** guide next steps

### **4. Production-Ready Architecture**
The system is built for **real-world deployment**:
- **Modular components** for easy maintenance
- **Database persistence** for audit compliance
- **Configuration management** for different environments
- **Performance monitoring** for operational insights

## 🚀 **Using These Diagrams**

When implementing or extending the system:

1. **Follow the data flow** in Diagram 1 to understand the complete process
2. **Reference the voting logic** in Diagram 2 when tuning algorithm weights
3. **Use the architecture** in Diagram 3 when adding new components or integrating with other systems

These diagrams demonstrate advanced concepts in:
- **Ensemble Learning** - combining multiple models for better performance
- **Human-AI Collaboration** - leveraging human expertise to improve AI
- **Adaptive Systems** - learning and evolving based on feedback
- **Explainable AI** - making AI decisions transparent and trustworthy

This represents a **production-grade, research-level approach** to data quality that goes far beyond simple rule-based checking!
